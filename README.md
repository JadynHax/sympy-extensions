# SymPy Extensions
SymPy Extensions is a module created to extend SymPy and provide a higher-level interface for manipulating expressions and equations.

## Installation
SymPy Extensions can be installed quite easily using `pip` like so:
```bash
pip install sympy-extensions
```

## Usage
To use SymPy Extensions within Python code, you must first import the module. For ease of use, we suggest using an `import` statement somewhat like this:
```py
import sympy_extensions as sympext
```
We feel this is a compact enough name for usage in the rest of your code, although we've come up with a few alternatives for you, should you prefer them:
```py
#
```
